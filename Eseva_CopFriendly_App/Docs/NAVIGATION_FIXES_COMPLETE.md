# 🚨 NAVIGATION ISSUES FIXED - ALL BUTTONS NOW WORK!

## ✅ Problem Identified and Resolved

**Issue:** Traffic Sergeant Dashboard buttons were taking users to blank pages instead of working properly.

**Root Cause:** Missing routes in the router configuration and incorrect route paths.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Added Missing Route: `/emergencies/create`

**Problem:** Multiple dashboards were trying to navigate to `/emergencies/create` but this route didn't exist.

**Solution:** 
- ✅ Created new `CreateEmergencyFormView.vue` component
- ✅ Added route configuration in `router/index.js`
- ✅ Full emergency registration form with:
  - Emergency type selection (Traffic Accident, Medical Emergency, Fire, etc.)
  - Location and landmark information
  - Severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
  - Casualty and vehicle counts
  - Emergency services required (Police, Ambulance, Fire, Traffic Control)
  - Reporter contact information
  - Additional notes

### 2. ✅ Fixed Incorrect Route: `/violations/approval` → `/violation-approval`

**Problem:** TrafficInspectorDashboard was using wrong route path.

**Solution:** 
- ✅ Updated `TrafficInspectorDashboardView.vue`
- ✅ Changed `/violations/approval` to `/violation-approval` (matches existing route)
